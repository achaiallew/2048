2048 WebGL Prototype



This is a WebGL prototype of the popular mobile puzzle game 2048, recreated in Unity for a game development assignment. The game retains the classic tile-sliding and merging mechanics while adding difficulty modes, an undo feature, and high score tracking.



Gameplay

> Slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine them and reach the 2048 tile.

> Easy mode allows unlimited undo moves so you can experiment with strategies.

> Hard mode disables undo to increase the challenge.

> The game tracks the player’s high score locally.

> Smooth animations, responsive controls, and visual feedback enhance the game feel.



Features

> Core 2048 mechanics: tile spawning, merging, and game state management (start, play, win, restart).

> Difficulty levels with adaptive gameplay.

> Undo system integrated with easy mode for strategic experimentation.

> Local high score tracking.

> WebGL-ready build for browser play, optimized for performance and smooth gameplay.

> Portrait 9:16 aspect ratio for mobile-friendly presentation.



Installation / Play

> The game is available as a WebGL build. You can play it directly in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) using the hosted link: https://katsuki73.itch.io/2048

> Alternatively, you can open the Unity project to explore or modify the source code:

> Clone or download this repository.

> Open the project in Unity 6 (or compatible version).

> Build the project for WebGL or your preferred platform.



Technical Overview

> Written in C# using Unity.

> Modular code architecture separating gameplay logic, UI, and audio.

> Optimized loops and tile management to maintain stable performance in WebGL.

> Smooth animations and colour transitions for engaging player feedback.



Creative Additions

> Undo Feature: Unlimited undos in easy mode, disabled in hard mode.

> Difficulty Modes: Easy and hard modes change gameplay strategy and challenge.

> High Score Tracking: Local tracking of the player’s best score.



Challenges \& Solutions

> Managing tile spawning and merging logic to avoid invalid moves.

> Ensuring responsive UI and animations across devices.



Future Improvements

> More visual polish and background music.

> Additional challenge modes or power-ups.

> Online high scores or social features.
